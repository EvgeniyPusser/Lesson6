Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'">serious

Your dog may bark, hop up and down, stare intently at whatever they want, whine, tremble, or show some other sign.

You may be familiar with the signs that your dog is happy in the moment—soft, relaxed ears and eyes, a wagging tail, puppy kisses, and a broad smile. However, dogs are individuals, and their activity levels and desire to be social vary as they grow and age.

The Pug has a short muzzle and a tightly curled tail. It is a squarely built muscular dog with a large head, prominent dark eyes, and small drooping ears. At maturity it stands 10 to 13 inches (25.5 to 33 cm) tall at the withers and weighs about 14 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg). Its coat is short and glossy; colour is given in the breed standard as black or as silver or apricot fawn with a black line on the back and a black mask on the face.
